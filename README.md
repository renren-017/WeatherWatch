# WeatherWatch API

## Short description of the project
WeatherWatch is a platform designed to monitor and manage weather data collected from various sensors. The API facilitates real-time and historical data analysis, helping meteorologists and researchers to analyze weather patterns and trends effectively.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage weather sensors including creation, reading, updating, and deleting sensor data.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secured access through basic authentication and OAuth 2.0.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Supports simultaneous requests ensuring high data availability and consistency.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Django 3.2+
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (required for deploying)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weatherwatch-api.git
   cd weatherwatch-api
   
2. **Create and fill out the .env file according to .env.example structure**

   
3. **Use docker for project builds**
    
    ```bash

## API Documentation ðŸ“„
Access the comprehensive API documentation at `/swagger/` after starting the application. This documentation includes:
- **Endpoint Details**: Complete information on all available endpoints.
- **Parameters**: Expected request parameters and methods.
- **Response Formats**: Structure of the expected responses.

## Security ðŸ”’
To ensure the security of the API:
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures endpoints to ensure that only authorized users have access.
- **HTTPS**: Encrypts data in transit, protecting sensitive data exchanges.

## Performance ðŸš€
To optimize performance and handle high loads, the API incorporates:
- **Caching**: Reduces database load by caching frequent requests.
- **Query Optimization**: Enhances database interactions using optimized queries and indexes.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Supports scaling out across multiple servers to manage increased traffic.

## Testing ðŸ§ª
Comprehensive testing strategies include:
- **Unit Testing**: Execute with `python manage.py test` to validate each unit of code.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures seamless interaction between different API components.

## FAQ ðŸ¤”
**Q: How do you handle data consistency?**
- **A:** We use database transactions to maintain consistency across all operations, even under concurrent access.

**Q: What data formats are supported?**
- **A:** The API exclusively utilizes JSON for data interchange due to its efficiency and broad support.
